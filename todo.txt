// Bugs + Features

1. Accomodate keycode combos for redo used by windows (and make sure other combos accomodated as well)
2. Tabbing a single line (with the top empty line also selected) multiple times doesnt work well
3. Add 4 spaces after bracket + enter combo
3. Universal mac style scrollbars for windows as well
4. <email> in .json file not being syntax highlighted
5. GetStarted page overlapping when window size is shrunk (possibly windows only)
6. Misalignment of text in text editor on horiz scroll to end on windows (likely because of extra room vert scrollbar is taking because custom scrollbar not working)

// Future things that would be nice but can't do right now
1. Have selected directory be the directory of terminal
