// Bugs + Features

1. Accomodate keycode combos for redo used by windows (and make sure other combos accomodated as well)
2. Tabbing a single line (with the top empty line also selected) multiple times doesnt work well
3. Add 4 spaces after bracket + enter combo
4. Bottom Scrollbar sometimes pops up (caused by text editor container not taking up entire height, possibly windows only?)

// Future things that would be nice but can't do right now
1. Have selected directory be the directory of terminal
